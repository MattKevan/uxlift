Everyone can become a great researcher. We make the journey easier.

Apple & Banana is a growing library of resources and was created in 2018 with two main goals:

1. To not dumb down research
2. To make research accessible for everyone

Why can’t good research content be accessible and smart?

That’s why we decided to build Apple & Banana: a place where anyone can become a fruitful researcher.
