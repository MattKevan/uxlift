 planners—Product managers map out the user journey and UX designers design the experience. 
 UX designers—This team makes the onboarding process visually appealing and easy to understand and use. 
 writers—They craft clear instructions and helpful messages. 
 user researchers—This team endeavors to understand what users need and how they feel about the onboarding process. 
 customer-support representatives—These people work directly with users to help them if they get stuck. 
 data analysts—They track the ways in which users interact with the onboarding process. 
 technology developers—This team builds the actual onboarding tools and features. 
 project manager—This person oversees the entire onboarding project and makes sure everything works well together.
